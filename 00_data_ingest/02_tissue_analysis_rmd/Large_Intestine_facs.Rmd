Enter the directory of the maca folder on your drive and the name of the tissue you want to analyze.

```{r}
tissue_of_interest = "Large_Intestine"
library(here)
source(here("00_data_ingest", "02_tissue_analysis_rmd", "boilerplate.R"))
tiss <- load_tissue_facs(tissue_of_interest)
```

Visualize top genes in principal components

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
PCHeatmap(object = tiss, pc.use = 1:3, cells.use = 500, do.balanced = TRUE, label.columns = FALSE, num.genes = 8)
```

Later on (in FindClusters and TSNE) you will pick a number of principal components to use. This has the effect of keeping the major directions of variation in the data and, ideally, supressing noise. There is no correct answer to the number to use, but a decent rule of thumb is to go until the plot plateaus.

```{r}
PCElbowPlot(object = tiss)
```

Choose the number of principal components to use.
```{r}
# Set number of principal components. 
n.pcs = 12
```


The clustering is performed based on a nearest neighbors graph. Cells that have similar expression will be joined together. The Louvain algorithm looks for groups of cells with high modularity--more connections within the group than between groups. The resolution parameter determines the scale...higher resolution will give more clusters, lower resolution will give fewer.

For the top-level clustering, aim to under-cluster instead of over-cluster. It will be easy to subset groups and further analyze them below.

```{r}
# Set resolution 
res.used <- 0.7

tiss <- FindClusters(object = tiss, reduction.type = "pca", dims.use = 1:n.pcs, 
    resolution = res.used, print.output = 0, save.SNN = TRUE)
```

To visualize 
```{r}
# If cells are too spread out, you can raise the perplexity. If you have few cells, try a lower perplexity (but never less than 10).
tiss <- RunTSNE(object = tiss, dims.use = 1:n.pcs, seed.use = 10, perplexity=30)
```

```{r}
# note that you can set do.label=T to help label individual clusters
TSNEPlot(object = tiss, do.label = T)
```

<!-- ## Compare to previous annotations -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- tiss = compare_previous_annotation(tiss, tissue_of_interest, "facs") -->
<!-- TSNEPlot(object = tiss, do.return = TRUE, group.by = "previous_cell_ontology_class") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Check expression of genes of interset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
genes_to_check = c('Lgr5', 'Krt20', 'Slc26a3', 'Atoh1', 'Spdef', 'Dclk1', 'Chga', 'Chgb', 'Mki67')
#genes_to_check = c('Alb', 'Cyp2f2', 'Cyp2e1', 'Hamp')

#FeaturePlot(tiss, genes_to_check, pt.size = 1, nCol = 3)
FeaturePlot(tiss, genes_to_check, pt.size = 0.5)
```

```{r}
#FeaturePlot(tiss, genes_to_check, pt.size = 1, nCol = 3)
FeaturePlot(tiss, c('Hoxb6', 'Hoxb13'), pt.size = 0.5)
```

```{r}
#FeaturePlot(tiss, genes_to_check, pt.size = 1, nCol = 3)
FeaturePlot(tiss, c('Hoxb6', 'Hoxb13'), pt.size = 0.5)
```

Dotplots let you see the intensity of exppression and the fraction of cells expressing for each of your genes of interest.

```{r}
# To get plots of two genes, add use.raw = T.
GenePlot(tiss, 'Lgr5', 'Krt20')
# To change the y-axis to show raw counts, add use.raw = T.
VlnPlot(tiss, genes_to_check)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
# To change the y-axis to show raw counts, add use.raw = T.
DotPlot(tiss, genes_to_check, plot.legend = T)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
# To change the y-axis to show raw counts, add use.raw = T.
DotPlot(tiss, genes_to_check, plot.legend = T, group.by='previous_cell_ontology_class')
```

How big are the clusters?
```{r}
table(tiss@ident)
```

Which markers identify a specific cluster?

```{r}
#clust.markers <- FindMarkers(object = tiss, ident.1 = 0, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, thresh.use = 0.25)
```

```{r}
#print(x = head(x= clust.markers, n = 10))
```

You can also compute all markers for all clusters at once. This may take some time.
```{r}
#tiss.markers <- FindAllMarkers(object = tiss, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, thresh.use = 0.25)
```

Display the top markers you computed above.
```{r}
#tiss.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(10, avg_logFC)
```

## Assigning cell type identity to clusters

At a coarse level, we can use canonical markers to match the unbiased clustering to known cell types:

```{r}
# stash current cluster IDs
tiss <- StashIdent(object = tiss, save.name = "cluster.ids")

# enumerate current cluster IDs and the labels for them
cluster.ids <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
free_annotation <-
  c(
    'Lgr5- amplifying undifferentiated cell', 
    'Lgr5+ undifferentiated cell (Proximal)', 
    'Enterocyte (Proximal)', 
    'Lgr5+ undifferentiated cell (Distal)', 
    'Lgr5- undifferentiated cell', 
    'Enterocyte (Proximal)', 
    'Goblet cell (Distal)', 
    'Goblet cell (Distal)', 
    'Enterocyte (Distal)', 
    'Lgr5+ amplifying undifferentiated cell (Proximal)', 
    'Goblet cell (Proximal)', 
    'Goblet cell (Proximal)', 
    'Lgr5+ amplifying undifferentiated cell (Distal)', 
    'Goblet cell, top of crypt (Distal)', 
    'Tuft cell', 
    'Chromaffin Cell'
    )

  cell_ontology_class <-
  c(
    "epithelial cell of large intestine",
    "epithelial cell of large intestine",
    "enterocyte of epithelium of large intestine",
    "epithelial cell of large intestine",
    "epithelial cell of large intestine",
    "enterocyte of epithelium of large intestine",
    "large intestine goblet cell",
    "large intestine goblet cell",
    "enterocyte of epithelium of large intestine",
    "epithelial cell of large intestine",
    "large intestine goblet cell",
    "large intestine goblet cell",
    "epithelial cell of large intestine",
    "large intestine goblet cell",
    "Brush cell of epithelium proper of large intestine",
    "enteroendocrine cell"
  )


tiss = stash_annotations(tiss, cluster.ids, free_annotation, cell_ontology_class)


TSNEPlot(object = tiss, do.label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5, group.by='cell_ontology_class')
```


## Checking for batch effects


Color by metadata, like plate barcode, to check for batch effects.
```{r}
TSNEPlot(object = tiss, do.return = TRUE, group.by = "plate.barcode")
```

```{r}
TSNEPlot(object = tiss, do.return = TRUE, group.by = "subtissue")
```

Print a table showing the count of cells in each identity category from each plate.

```{r}
table(as.character(tiss@ident), as.character(tiss@meta.data$plate.barcode))
```

# Saving

```{r}
filename = here('00_data_ingest', '04_tissue_robj_generated', 
                     paste0("facs_", tissue_of_interest, "_seurat_tiss.Robj"))
print(filename)
save(tiss, file=filename)
```

```{r}
# To reload a saved object
# filename = here('00_data_ingest', '04_tissue_robj_generated',
#                      paste0("facs", tissue_of_interest, "_seurat_tiss.Robj"))
# load(file=filename)
```

# Export the final metadata


Write the cell ontology and free annotations to CSV.

```{r}
save_annotation_csv(tiss, tissue_of_interest, "facs")
```
