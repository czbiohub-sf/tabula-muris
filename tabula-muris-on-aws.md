# Tabula muris on AWS
The **Tabula muris** data was generated by the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and made available for anyone to use via Amazon S3.

This data collection is the underlying dataset to the recent publication [Transcriptomic characterization of 20 organs and tissues from mouse at single cell resolution creates a Tabula Muris](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4). The Tabula muris project is a a compendium of single cell transcriptomic data from the mouse containing nearly 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. The data allow for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as immune cells from distinct anatomical locations. The resource also enables contrasting two distinct technical approaches:

* microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, which provides a survey of thousands of cells per organ at relatively low coverage.
* FACS-based full length transcript analysis, which provides higher sensitivity and coverage.

This rich collection of annotated cells will be a useful resource for:

* Defining gene expression in previously poorly-characterized cell populations.
* Validating findings in future targeted single-cell studies.
* Developing of methods for integrating datasets (eg between the FACS and droplet experiments), characterizing batch effects, and quantifying the variation of gene expression in many cell types between organs and animals.

Since late 2017, Tabula muris data have been made available to all users free of charge. AWS has made the data freely available on Amazon S3 so that anyone can download the resource to perform analysis and advance medical discovery without needing to worry about the cost of storing Tabula muris data or the time required to download it.

# Accessing Tabula muris on AWS
The data are organized using a directory structure as bellow.

```
czbiohub-tabula-muris
├── 10x_bam_files: BAM files for 10x droplet data
│   ├── *.bam
│   └── *.bam.bai
├── tabula_muris_bam_files : BAM files for FACS smartseq2 data
│   ├── *.bam
│   └── *.bam.bai
├── TM_droplet_mat.csv.gz
├── TM_droplet_mat.h5ad
├── TM_droplet_mat.rds
├── TM_droplet_metadata.csv
├── TM_facs_mat.csv.gz
├── TM_facs_mat.h5ad
├── TM_facs_mat.rds
└── TM_facs_metadata.csv
```

The unprocessed data files are stored in two different folders, `10x_bam_files` and `tabula_muris_bam_files`, according to the respective method used when preparing the samples, `10x` or `FACS`. *Is this correct? If yes, then I suggest changing the the folder name to facs_bam_files.*

The processed data is provide in three different formats for each of the two methods:
* `.h5ad` files to load in Python using [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/)
* `.rds` files to load in R
* `.csv.gz` files for general use

A csv describing all data is available for each method at `s3://czbiohub-tabula-muris/TM_facs_metadata.csv` or `s3://czbiohub-tabula-muris/TM_droplet_metadata.csv`

If you use the AWS Command Line Interface, you can access the bucket with the command: `aws s3 ls s3://czbiohub-tabula-muris`

# How to start using the data
## Data files for R

You can download complete count files as sparse matrices in `.rds` format for easy loading into `R`. Download [TM_facs_mat.rds](https://s3.amazonaws.com/czbiohub-tabula-muris/TM_facs_mat.rds) and [TM_droplet_mat.rds](https://s3.amazonaws.com/czbiohub-tabula-muris/TM_droplet_mat.rds) into the `data` folder. It can be loaded as

```R
tm.droplet.matrix = readRDS(here("data", "TM_droplet_mat.rds"))
tm.droplet.metadata = read_csv(here("data", "TM_droplet_metadata.csv"))
```

## Data files for Python

You can download complete count files as sparse matrices using [anndata's](http://anndata.readthedocs.io) `h5ad` file format  for use in Python [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/czbiohub-tabula-muris/TM_droplet_mat.h5ad) and [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/czbiohub-tabula-muris/TM_facs_mat.h5ad). You can process the resulting `AnnData` object using, for instance, [Scanpy](http://scanpy.readthedocs.io).

```python
import pandas
import scanpy

tm_facs_metadata = pd.read_csv('data/TM_facs_metadata.csv')
tm_facs_data = scanpy.anndata.read_h5ad('data/TM_facs_mat.h5ad')
```
